<h2> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Some information about me:</h2>

- Name: Chun Yin (Walter) Mak / chunyin.mak@mail.utoronto.ca

- Education: Currently a Math & CS undergraduate at the University of Toronto

## Current responsibilities:
- I'm currently a front and backend developer at C.R.E.A.T.E UofT 
- working on the Persian archive website [demo](https://dead-poet-society.vercel.app), which holds thousands of multimedia literature files.
- Back-end featuers: includes separate tables for storing fields and values of files, making it possible for administrators to add custom fields.
- Front-end, a minimalistic UI implemented with React and Tailwind CSS provided the user with an intuitive way to interact with the stored content.
I'm looking for a position that'll allow me to make use of my existing development skills with React and Django, while learning about writing production-grade code using a relevant tech stack.
